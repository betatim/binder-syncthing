# binder syncthing

Launch binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/binder-syncthing/master

Once your binder instance is running you can visit the syncthing instance by replaceing `/tree` with `/proxy/8384/` at the end of the URL.

Currently something isn't properly configured (see [#1](https://github.com/betatim/binder-syncthing/issues/1)), help would be welcome.
